      "_by Greg Smith, Robert Treat, and Christopher Browne_\n",
      "\n",
      "PostgreSQL ships with a basic configuration tuned for wide compatibility rather than performance. Odds are good the default parameters are very undersized for your system. Rather than get dragged into the details of everything you should eventually know (which you can find if you want it at the [GUC Three Hour Tour][1]), here we're going to sprint through a simplified view of the basics, with a look at the most common things people new to PostgreSQL aren't aware of. You should click on the name of the parameter in each section to jump to the relevant documentation in the PostgreSQL manual for more details after reading the quick intro here. There is also additional information available about many of these parameters, as well as a list of parameters you shouldn't adjust, at [Server Configuration Tuning][2].\n",
      "\n",
      "##  Background Information on Configuration Settings\n",
      "\n",
      "PostgreSQL settings can be manipulated a number of different ways, but generally you will want to update them in your postgresql.conf file. The specific options available change from release to release, the definitive list is in the source code at src/backend/utils/misc/guc.c for your version of PostgreSQL (but the pg_settings view works well enough for most purposes).\n",
      "\n",
      "###  The types of settings\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several different types of configuration settings, divided up based on the possible inputs they take\n",
      "\n",
      "* Boolean: true, false, on, off\n",
      "* Integer: Whole numbers (2112)\n",
      "* Float: Decimal values (21.12)\n",
      "* Memory / Disk: Integers (2112) or \"computer units\" (512MB, 2112GB). Avoid integers--you need to know the underlying unit to figure out what they mean.\n",
      "* Time: \"Time units\" aka d,m,s (30s). Sometimes the unit is left out; don't do that\n",
      "* Strings: Single quoted text ('pg_log')\n",
      "* ENUMs: Strings, but from a specific list ('WARNING', 'ERROR')\n",
      "* Lists: A comma separated list of strings ('\"$user\",public,tsearch2)\n",
      "\n",
      "###  When they take effect\n",
      "\n",
      "PostgreSQL settings have different levels of flexibility for when they can be changed, usually related to internal code restrictions. The complete list of levels is:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Postmaster: requires restart of server\n",
      "* Sighup: requires a HUP of the server, either by kill -HUP (usually -1), pg_ctl reload, or select pg_reload_conf();\n",
      "* User: can be set within individual sessions, take effect only within that session\n",
      "* Internal: set at compile time, can't be changed, mainly for reference\n",
      "* Backend: settings which must be set before session start\n",
      "* Superuser: can be set at runtime for the server by superusers\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time you'll only use the first of these, but the second can be useful if you have a server you don't want to take down, while the user session settings can be helpful for some special situations. You can tell which type of parameter a setting is by looking at the \"context\" field in the pg_settings view.\n",
      "\n",
      "###  Important notes about postgresql.conf\n",
      "\n",
      "* You should be able to find it at $PGDATA/postgresql.conf; watch out for symbolic links and other trickiness\n",
      "* You can figure out the file location with _SHOW config_file_\n",
      "* Lines with # are comments and have no effect. For a new database, this will mean the setting is using the default, but on running systems this may not hold true! Changes to the postgresql.conf do not take effect without a reload/restart, so it's possible for the system to be running something different from what is in the file.\n",
      "* If the same setting is listed multiple times, the last one wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "###  Viewing the current settings\n",
      "\n",
      "* Look in postgresql.conf. This works if you follow good practice, but it's not definitive!\n",
      "* _show all_, _show _ will show you the current value of the setting. Watch out for session specific changes\n",
      "* _select * from pg_settings_ will label session specific changes as locally modified"

Even on a modern Linux system, the stock kernel will likely not allow setting shared_buffers to over 32MB without adjusting kernel settings first. (PostgreSQL 9.3 and later use a different shared memory mechanism, so kernel settings will usually not have to be adjusted there.)\n",

If you have less RAM you'll have to account more carefully for how much RAM the OS is taking up; closer to 15% is more typical there. There are some workloads where even larger settings for shared_buffers are effective, but given the way PostgreSQL also relies on the operating system cache, it's unlikely you'll find using more than 40% of RAM to work better than a smaller amount.\n",

This value is used only by the PostgreSQL query planner to figure out whether plans it's considering would be expected to fit in RAM or not.

      "PostgreSQL writes new transactions to the database in files called WAL segments that are 16MB in size. Every time checkpoint_segments worth of these files have been written, by default 3, a checkpoint occurs. Checkpoints can be resource intensive, and on a modern system doing one every 48MB will be a serious performance bottleneck. Setting checkpoint_segments to a much larger value improves that. Unless you're running on a very small configuration, you'll almost certainly be better setting this to at least 10, which also allows usefully increasing the completion target.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more write-heavy systems, values from 32 (checkpoint every 512MB) to 256 (every 4GB) are popular nowadays. Very large settings use a lot more disk and will cause your database to take longer to recover, so make sure you're comfortable with both those things before large increases. Normally the large settings (>64/1GB) are only used for bulk loading. Note that whatever you choose for the segments, you'll still get a checkpoint at least every 5 minutes unless you also increase checkpoint_timeout (which isn't necessary on most systems).\n",
      "\n",
      "Checkpoint writes are spread out a bit while the system starts working toward the next checkpoint. You can spread those writes out further, lowering the average write overhead, by increasing the checkpoint_completion_target parameter to its useful maximum of 0.9 (aim to finish by the time 90% of the next checkpoint is here) rather than the default of 0.5 (aim to finish when the next one is 50% done). A setting of 0 gives something similar to the behavior of obsolete versions. The main reason the default isn't just 0.9 is that you need a larger checkpoint_segments value than the default for broader spreading to work well. For lots more information on checkpoint tuning, see [Checkpoints and the Background Writer][7] (where you'll also learn why tuning the background writer parameters is challenging to do usefully)."

Best practice would be to try and make this as similar as possible across your servers. Note that in some cases, the init script starting your database may be customizing the log destination in the command line used to start the database, overriding what's in the postgresql.conf (and making it so you'll get different behavior if you run pg_ctl manually instead of using the init script).\n",

A good generic recommendation is '%t:%r:%u@%d:[%p]: ' : %t=timestamp, %u=db user name, %r=host connecting from, %d=database connecting to, %p=PID of connection. It may not be obvious what the PID is useful at first, but it can be vital for trying to troubleshoot problems in the future so better to put in the logs from the start.\n",

See [Tuning PostgreSQL WAL Synchronization][11] for a lot of background on this topic. Note that open_sync writing is buggy on some platforms (such as [Linux][12]), and you should (as always) do plenty of tests under a heavy write load to make sure that you haven't made your system less stable with this change.

Some feel that 4.0 is always too large on current hardware; it's not unusual for administrators to standardize on always setting this between 2.0 and 3.0 instead. In some cases that behavior is a holdover from earlier PostgreSQL versions where having random_page_cost too high was more likely to screw up plan optimization than it is now (and setting at or below 2.0 was regularlly necessary). Since these cost estimates are just that--estimates--it shouldn't hurt to try lower values.\n",

Instead, you should start by making sure autovacuum is working properly, that you are collecting enough statistics, and that you have correctly sized the memory parameters for your server--all the things gone over above. After you've done all those much more important things, if you're still getting bad plans _then_ you should see if lowering random_page_cost is still useful."
