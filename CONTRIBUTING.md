## Team Processes

* Use PEP8 as the coding standard for Python (but don't worry about fitting lines within 79 characters).
* Pull requests for all commits, even typos.
* Don't merge your own pull request. Find a friend to review your code and merge your pull request.
* Pull requests contain some tests. Ideally they would contain decent test coverage.

#### Issues

When creating a task through the issue tracker, please include the following where applicable: 

* A summary of identified tasks related to the issue; and
* Any dependencies related to completion of the task (include links to tickets with the dependency).

Design and feature request issues should include:
* What the goal of the task being accomplished is; and
* The user need being addressed.

Development issues should include:
* Unknowns tasks or dependencies that need investigation; and
* [The boilerplate tasks for each development issue](https://gist.github.com/theresaanna/86be7e29214a7f31ab73).

#### Commit messages

- Usually start with a verb. Like “added” or “changed” or “removed”.
- Generally follow [50/72 format](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2290016/git-commit-messages-50-72-formatting).
- Reference a ticket number, where available, with "#555" if additional work is needed on the issue or “fixes #555” or any of the other [keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if the commit resolves the issue.
- Be sure to talk about the nature of the change you're making instead of describing the bug or task. Explain why the change was needed if it is relevant.


#### Pull Requests

When creating a new pull request:

* Be sure that the message contains a summary of the work that is included in the pull request.
* If the pull request is still a work-in-progress and should not be merged, include that in the description and then **assign the PR to yourself**. When the PR is ready to be merged, **unassign yourself and add a comment**.
* If a new pull request is ready for review, **leave it unassigned**. This is the assumed state of new PRs, but work-in-progress PRs are quite welcome.
* If you decide to review a pull request with the intent of merging it (or deciding what still needs to be done before merge), then **assign the PR to yourself** so that it's clear that someone's grabbed it.
* Anyone is welcome to informally review a PR and comment on it at any time, no matter who is assigned.
