## Welcome
We're glad you're thinking about contributing to an FEC open source project! If you're unsure about anything, ask us — or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is that we’ll politely ask you to change something.

We love all friendly contributions, and we welcome your ideas about how to make the FEC's online presence more user friendly, accessible and elegant.

To ensure a welcoming environment for our projects, our staff follows the FEC Code of Conduct [pending]; contributors should do the same. Please also check out the [FEC Open Source Policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/OPEN-SOURCE-POLICY.md).

If you’d prefer, you can also reach us by [email](mailto:opensource@fec.gov).

For our full contributing guidelines, please see our [Default Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
