API_DESCRIPTION = '''
This application programming interface (API) allows you to explore the way \
candidates and committees fund their campaigns.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on
FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current
site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated
nightly.

There are a lot of data, and a good place to start is to use search to find
interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line
item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check
out contributor information in the `/schedule_a/` endpoints.

<b class="body" id="getting_started_head">Getting started with the openFEC API</b><br>

If you would like to use the FEC's API programmatically, you can sign up for your own API \
key using our form. Alternatively, you can still try out our API without an API key by using \
the web interface and using DEMO_KEY. Note that when you use the openFEC API you are \
subject to the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md) \
and [Acceptable Use policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/ACCEPTABLE-USE-POLICY.md).

Signing up for an API key will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call \
is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get \
a key for 7,200 calls an hour (120 calls per minute) to <a href="mailto:APIinfo@fec.gov">APIinfo@fec.gov</a>. You \
can also ask questions and discuss the data in a community led \
[group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data).

The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for
making wrappers and exploring the data.

A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor
lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations.

# ======== candidate start ===========
CANDIDATE_TAG = '''
Candidate endpoints give you access to information about the people running for office.
This information is organized by candidate_id. If you're unfamiliar with candidate IDs,
using `/candidates/search` will help you locate a particular candidate.

Officially, a candidate is an individual seeking nomination for election to a federal
office. People become candidates when they (or agents working on their behalf)
raise contributions or make expenditures that exceed $5,000.

The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration
[Form 1](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and
[Form 2](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/fecfrm2.pdf), for committee information.
'''

CANDIDATE_ID = '''
A unique identifier assigned to each candidate registered with the FEC.
If a person runs for several offices, that person will have separate candidate IDs for each office.
'''

CANDIDATE_INACTIVE = '''
True indicates that a candidate is inactive.
'''

CANDIDATE_CYCLE = '''
Two-year election cycle in which a candidate runs for office.
Calculated from Form 2. The cycle begins with
an odd year and is named for its ending, even year. This cycle follows
the traditional house election cycle and subdivides the presidential
and Senate elections into comparable two-year blocks. To retrieve data for
the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,
you will need the `election_full` flag.
'''

# committee uses a different definition for cycle because it is less straight forward
CYCLE = '''
Filter records to only those that are applicable to a given two-year
period. This cycle follows the traditional House election cycle and
subdivides the presidential and Senate elections into comparable
two-year blocks. The cycle begins with an odd year and is named for its
ending, even year.
'''

NAME_SEARCH = '''
Search for candidates or committees by name. If you're looking for information on a
particular person or group, using a name to find the `candidate_id` or `committee_id` on
this endpoint can be a helpful first step.
'''

CANDIDATE_LIST = '''
Fetch basic information about candidates, and use parameters to filter results to the
candidates you're looking for.

Each result reflects a unique FEC candidate ID. That ID is particular to the candidate for a
particular office sought. If a candidate runs for the same office multiple times, the ID
stays the same. If the same person runs for another office — for example, a House
candidate runs for a Senate office — that candidate will get a unique ID for each office.
'''

CANDIDATE_HISTORY = '''
Find out a candidate's characteristics over time. This is particularly useful if the
candidate runs for the same office in different districts or you want to know more about a candidate's
previous races.

This information is organized by `candidate_id`, so it won't help you find a candidate
who ran for different offices over time; candidates get a new ID for each office.
'''

CANDIDATE_SEARCH = '''
Fetch basic information about candidates and their principal committees.

Each result reflects a unique FEC candidate ID. That ID is assigned to the candidate for a
particular office sought. If a candidate runs for the same office over time, that ID
stays the same. If the same person runs for multiple offices — for example, a House
candidate runs for a Senate office — that candidate will get a unique ID for each office.

The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration
[Form 1](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and
[Form 2](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm2.pdf), for committees information, with additional information

COMMITTEE_TAG = '''
Committees are entities that spend and raise money in an election. Their characteristics and
relationships with candidates can change over time.

You might want to use filters or search endpoints to find the committee you're looking
for. Then you can use other committee endpoints to explore information about the committee
that interests you.

Financial information is organized by `committee_id`, so finding the committee you're interested in
will lead you to more granular financial information.

The committee endpoints include all FEC filers, even if they aren't registered as a committee.

Officially, committees include the committees and organizations that file with the FEC.
Several different types of organizations file financial reports with the FEC:

*Campaign committees authorized by particular candidates to raise and spend funds in
their campaigns. Non-party committees (e.g., PACs), some of which may be sponsored by corporations,
unions, trade or membership groups, etc. Political party committees at the national, state, and local levels.
Groups and individuals making only independent expenditures
Corporations, unions, and other organizations making internal communications*

The committee endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration Form 1 and Form 2.

Fetch key information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports.

Most committees are required to summarize their financial activity in each filing; those summaries
are included in these files. Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but
some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary
season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals
also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended.

Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed. Keep in mind, complex
paper filings take longer to process.

The financial endpoints use data from FEC [form 5](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf),
for independent expenditors; or the summary and detailed summary pages of the FEC
[Form 3](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3.pdf), for House and Senate committees;
[Form 3X](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf), for PACs and parties;

Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.
These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.
Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements
are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.

By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict
to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that
have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.

Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that
submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,
look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and \
`last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and \
when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` \
and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results \
using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` \
(`deprecated`, will be descending). \
If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out.

Calls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record \
counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records \
until no records are returned.

To avoid throwing the "out of range" exception on the last page, one recommandation is \
to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.

​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does \
include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.

'''

SUB_ID = '''
A unique database identifier for itemized receipts or disbursements.
'''

SCHEDULE_B_TAG = '''
Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data
explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are
reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.
'''

SCHEDULE_B = SCHEDULE_B_TAG + '''
The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which
is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will
default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,
even-numbered year.

Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of
results with the following pagination information:

```
pagination: {\n\
    pages: 965191,\n\
    per_page: 20,\n\
    count: 19303814,\n\
    last_indexes: {\n\

}\n\
```

To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and
`last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.
`last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.
This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.

Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for
large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

'''

SCHEDULE_D_TAG = '''
Schedule D, it shows debts and obligations owed to or by the committee that are

'''

SCHEDULE_E_TAG = '''
Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC
bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with
the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.

An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or
defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,
or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or
a political party or its agents."

Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures
and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in
`/schedule/schedule_e/`.
'''

SCHEDULE_E = SCHEDULE_E_TAG + '''
Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
