API_DESCRIPTION = '''
This API allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns.

The FEC API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on
FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current
site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated
nightly.

There is a lot of data, but a good place to start is to use search to find
interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line
item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check
out contributor information in schedule_a.

Get an [API key here](https://api.data.gov/signup/). That will enable you to place up to 1,000
calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or
a request to get a key for 120 calls per minute to [APIinfo@fec.gov](mailto:apiinfo@fec.gov). You can also
ask questions and discuss the data in the [FEC data Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data).
API changes will also be added to this group in advance of the change.


The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for
making wrappers and exploring the data.

A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor
lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations.

'''

CANDIDATE_TAG = '''
Candidate endpoints give you access to information about the people running for office.
This information is organized by candidate_id. If you're unfamiliar with candidate IDs,
using `/candidates/search` will help you locate a particular candidate.

Officially, a candidate is an individual seeking nomination for election to a federal
office. People become candidates when they (or agents working on their behalf)
raise contributions or make expenditures that exceed $5,000.

The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration
[Form 1](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and
[Form 2](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm2.pdf), for committee information.
'''

NAME_SEARCH = '''
Search for candidates or committees by name. If you're looking for information on a
particular person or group, using a name to find the `candidate_id` or `committee_id` on
this endpoint can be a helpful first step.
'''

LEGAL_SEARCH = '''
Search for legal documents.
'''

CANDIDATE_LIST = '''
Fetch basic information about candidates, and use parameters to filter results to the
candidates you're looking for.

Each result reflects a unique FEC candidate ID. That ID is particular to the candidate for a
particular office sought. If a candidate runs for the same office multiple times, the ID
stays the same. If the same person runs for another office — for example, a House
candidate runs for a Senate office — that candidate will get a unique ID for each office.
'''

CANDIDATE_HISTORY = '''
Find out a candidate's characteristics over time. This is particularly useful if the
candidate runs for the same office in different districts or you want to know more about a candidate's
previous races.

This information is organized by `candidate_id`, so it won't help you find a candidate
who ran for different offices over time; candidates get a new ID for each office.
'''

CANDIDATE_SEARCH = '''
Fetch basic information about candidates and their principal committees.

Each result reflects a unique FEC candidate ID. That ID is assigned to the candidate for a
particular office sought. If a candidate runs for the same office over time, that ID
stays the same. If the same person runs for multiple offices — for example, a House
candidate runs for a Senate office — that candidate will get a unique ID for each office.

The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration
[Form 1](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and
[Form 2](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm2.pdf), for committees information, with additional information
to provide context.
'''

CANDIDATE_DETAIL = '''
This endpoint is useful for finding detailed information about a particular candidate. Use the
`candidate_id` to find the most recent information about that candidate.

'''

COMMITTEE_TAG = '''
Committees are entities that spend and raise money in an election. Their characteristics and
relationships with candidates can change over time.

You might want to use filters or search endpoints to find the committee you're looking
for. Then you can use other committee endpoints to explore information about the committee
that interests you.

Financial information is organized by `committee_id`, so finding the committee you're interested in
will lead you to more granular financial information.

The committee endpoints include all FEC filers, even if they aren't registered as a committee.

Officially, committees include the committees and organizations that file with the FEC.
Several different types of organizations file financial reports with the FEC:

*Campaign committees authorized by particular candidates to raise and spend funds in
their campaigns. Non-party committees (e.g., PACs), some of which may be sponsored by corporations,
unions, trade or membership groups, etc. Political party committees at the national, state, and local levels.
Groups and individuals making only independent expenditures
Corporations, unions, and other organizations making internal communications*

The committee endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration Form 1 and Form 2.
'''

COMMITTEE_LIST = '''
Fetch basic information about committees and filers. Use parameters to filter for
particular characteristics.

'''

COMMITTEE_DETAIL = '''
This endpoint is useful for finding detailed information about a particular committee or
filer. Use the `committee_id` to find the most recent information about the committee.
'''

COMMITTEE_HISTORY = '''
Explore a filer's characteristics over time. This can be particularly useful if the
committees change treasurers, designation, or `committee_type`.
'''

ELECTION_SEARCH = '''
List elections by cycle, office, state, and district.
'''

ELECTIONS = '''
Look at the top-level financial information for all candidates running for the same
office.

Choose a 2-year cycle, and `house`, `senate` or `presidential`.

If you are looking for a Senate seat, you will need to select the state using a two-letter
abbreviation.

House races require state and a two-digit district number.

Since this endpoint reflects financial information, it will only have candidates once they file
financial reporting forms. Query the `/candidates` endpoint to see an up to date list of all the
candidates that filed to run for a particular seat.
'''
STATE_ELECTION_OFFICES = '''
State laws and procedures govern elections for state or local offices as well as
how candidates appear on election ballots.
Contact the appropriate state election office for more information.
'''
STATE_ELECTION_OFFICES_ADDRESS = '''
Enter a state (Ex: AK, TX, VA etc..) to find the local election offices contact
information.

'''

FINANCIAL_TAG = '''
Fetch key information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports.

Most committees are required to summarize their financial activity in each filing; those summaries
are included in these files. Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but
some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary
season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals
also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended.

Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed. Keep in mind, complex
paper filings take longer to process.

The financial endpoints use data from FEC [form 5](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf),
for independent expenditors; or the summary and detailed summary pages of the FEC
[Form 3](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3.pdf), for House and Senate committees;
[Form 3X](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf), for PACs and parties;
and [Form 3P](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3p.pdf), for presidential committees.
'''

WIP_TAG = '''
DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly
label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.
'''

REPORTS = '''
Each report represents the summary information from FEC Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.
These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.
Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements
are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.

By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict
to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to view only reports that
have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.

Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that
submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,
look at the summary and detailed summary pages of FEC Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.
'''

REPORTS += WIP_TAG

REPORT_YEAR = '''

years so this can differ from underlying form's receipt date.
'''

IS_AMENDED = '''

'''

MOST_RECENT = '''
Report is either new or is the most-recently filed amendment
'''

TWO_YEAR_TRANSACTION_PERIOD = '''
This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the
Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction
(contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)
the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
specified, the results default to the most current cycle.
'''

TOTALS = '''
This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.

The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To see
totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.
'''

SCHEDULE_A_TAG = '''
Schedule A records describe itemized receipts reported by a committee. This is where
you can look for individual contributors. If you are interested in
individual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the endpoint you use.

Once a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be
reported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms.

Contributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total
amount of these small donations by looking up the "unitemized" field in the `/reports`
or `/totals` endpoints.

When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you
only look at items where `"is_individual":true` since the same transaction is in the data
multiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark.
See the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details.

For the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual
contributions. See below for full methodology.

__Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__

For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals.

The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included:

Line number with description
    - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),\n\
         Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)\n\
         and nonfederal party "soft money" accounts (1991-2002)\n\
         from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company,\n\
         corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or\n\
         group of persons)
    - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs\n\
         and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or\n\
         limited liability company
    - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees\n\
          (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual,\n\
          partnership or limited liability company
    - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n\
          from an individual, partnership or limited liability\n\
          company given to joint fundraising committee
    - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n\
          from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee\n\
    - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes\n\

For receipts under $200:
We check the following codes and see if there is "earmark" (or a variation) in the `memo_text`
description of the contribution.

Line number with description
    -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A\n\
    -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2)\n\
    -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n\
    -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n\
    -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n\

Of those transactions,[under $200, and having "earmark" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.

'''

SCHEDULE_A = SCHEDULE_A_TAG + '''
All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which
is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results
will default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,
even-numbered year.

Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of
results with the following pagination information:

```
pagination: {\n\
    pages: 2152643,\n\
    per_page: 20,\n\
    count: 43052850,\n\
    last_indexes: {\n\
        last_index: "230880619",\n\
        last_contribution_receipt_date: "2014-01-01"\n\
    }\n\
}\n\
```

To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and
`last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
these results by using sort indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources may be
unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices
are required to properly page through this large dataset.

Note: because the Schedule A data includes many records, counts for
large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or
defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,
or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or
a political party or its agents."

Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures
