/*
This is to solve issue #4595
Ticket #4561 had documented most of the hisory of how the sql for this MV evolved.

To facilitate systematic tracking of the committees that convert from PCC to PAC mid cycle 

** dim_cmte_ie_inf:
The major table this tracking relying on is DISCLOSURE.DIM_CMTE_IE_INF (which is added in postgresql database with migration file V0212)
When a committee's cmte_tp or cmte_dsgn changed, there will be a new row added to DISCLOSURE.DIM_CMTE_IE_INF.  
There is no financial cycle (fec_election_yr) concept in the DISCLOSURE.DIM_CMTE_IE_INF, 
the fec_election_yr in this view is derived from the create_date column in the dim_cmte_ie_inf table. 

NOTE: revert back to rows created in earlier cycles (some revert back to rows entered more than 10 years ago)
no new rows created, just mst_rct_rcd_flg='Y' in the old record 
there is no way to trace it (revert back to row in the same cycle can be catched.)

The base concept is treat each financial cycle as a "window".  
If a cmte is a pcc at the beginning of the "window", and had been turned into a pac at the end of the "window", it will be included in this MV.

** ofec_cand_cmte_linkage_mv:
is used to link candidate and committee

** ofec_candidate_history_mv: 
is used to filter out the fec_election_yr that is not part of a election.

** ofec_totals_combined_mv:
is used to filter out committees that does not have financial activity (not filing report or money is 0)

According to Brad and Paul, 
Although money will dissociate from the candidate after convert to party, the PCC converted to Party (cmte_tp: X, Y) will be excluded as mid-cycle conversion. 
- A PCC is allowed to convert into PAC but not other type of committees,
- the specific language that is used on the web site is for PCC to PAC conversion.

** ofec_pcc_conversion_exclude table 
There are cases that data not consistent with reality 
for example, 
- last registered to run 2018.  But F2z shows registered for 2022
- in dim_cmte_ie_inf table, revert back to rows created in earlier cycles (some revert back to rows entered more than 10 years ago)
