/*
This is to solve openFEC issue #3582:
The value for operating_expenditures and fed_operating_expenditures is incorrect for F3X filing committees. 
The unerline ofec_totals_combined_mv, which feeds the ofec_totals_pacs_parties_mv/vw 
only use op_exp_per as the source for operating_expenditures column.
That is correct for F3/F3P but for F3X needs to use the ttl_op_exp_per column. 

The following change is made to the base ofec_totals_combined_mv:
(case when vsd.form_tp_cd = 'F3X' then vsd.ttl_op_exp_per else vsd.op_exp_per end)
