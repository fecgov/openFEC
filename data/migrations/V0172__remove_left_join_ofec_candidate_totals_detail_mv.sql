/* 11/07/2019
This migration file is to solve the issue https://github.com/fecgov/fec-cms/issues/3336
One candidate has a record in linkage (has commitee), but without filing any financial form,
ofec_candidate_totals_detail_mv should return no data for that candidate.
Changes include:
1)remove the `LEFT` join for ofec_committee_totals_per_cycle_vw based on linkage
2)add ofec_cand_cmte_linkage_vw.fec_election_yr >= 1979 into subquery:linkage
*/

/* This materialized view has all the totals of all candidates,
  election_full = false: totals for fec_cycle.
  election_full = true:  totals for candidate_election_year
*/
--- subquery linkage is created to handle case that candidates run more than one elections in one fec_cycle. Example: H0PA12181, H8NC09123
--- subquery cand_total_per_cycle calculates totals per candidate per fec_cycle ( election_full = false ). Candidate with multiple committees will be aggregated here
--- subquery cand_ending_total_per_election calculates 5 ending totals per candidate per candidate_election_year
--- subquery cand_total_per_election calculates totals per candidate per candidate_election_year ( election_full = true )

-- View: public.ofec_candidate_totals_detail_mv

-- DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW public.ofec_candidate_totals_detail_mv;

-- 1)create a ofec_xxxxxxx_mv_tmp
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS public.ofec_candidate_totals_detail_mv_tmp;
