This is part of migration files solving issues 
	#3768 Candidate missing from /candidates/totals
	#3709 Candidate totals incorrect for one candidate ("Puerto Rico's resident commissioner has a 4-year election cycle. Even though the commissioner serves in the house.")

ofec_candidate_totals_mv has two major components, one from financial side, one from the candidate site.
There are two major types of candidates that caused the mismatch of these two worlds. 
- candidates has committees but did not file financial reports
- candidates has no committees at all

We had noticed the candidate_election_year logic has problem.
In previous ticket #3700, we had fixed the financial side.  
In another ticket #3736, the candidate side had been fixed.
This ticket we combined the two sides together with some minor updates
we noticed from previous tickets.
