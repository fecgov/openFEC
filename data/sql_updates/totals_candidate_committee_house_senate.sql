-- House/Senate totals are same process as presidential but in separate file to handle columns that are
-- unique to a congressional candidate.  Otherwise aggregation and relations are the same.

-- Note: Beginning cash on hand, ending cash on hand debts and loans are all numbers that
-- represent a the total amount of something at point in time and should not be added.
-- Adding cycle to the sort helps if there is a null date - this was a problem at some point.
